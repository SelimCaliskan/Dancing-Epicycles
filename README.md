# Dancing-Epicycles
A pendulum blessed by Joseph Fouriér himself.


This is my take on the 2023-2024 Exemption Project for RAS. 

As messy as the code is, this project is my first experience with almost everything
in the project: CMake, Raylib, and of course Mr. Fouriér :)

You can automatically build-and-run my project by simply running the so-called .bat file
(If you have CMake installed on your computer, of course.)


Enjoy the bilateral randomness of my pendulum, or give it something to draw!
